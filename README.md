Really mind-blowing gadgets are rare these days. Very seldom you stumble across something truly magical that leaves you in a state of confusion and amazement.

This project is inspired by water drop levitating installations such as shown by many museums around the world (eg. LINK TO VIDEO) and the “Slow Dance” kickstarter campaign by Jeff Lieberman.

The illusion works using strobe light to and a fast repetitive motion. Each flash of the strobe light is illuminating a slightly different position of the object that is actually moving too fast to capture this motion with the naked eye. Due to the small difference in the frequency of the motion and the strobe light a slow motion effect is generated that suggests the object is only traveling very little distance from strobe to strobe. The frequency of the strobes is between 75 and 85 Hz and not visible.
